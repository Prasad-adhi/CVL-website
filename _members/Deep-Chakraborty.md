I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst where I investigate fundamental problems in computer vision through the lens of self-supervised learning and information theory, under the supervision of Erik Learned-Miller at the Vision lab.

I have also worked with Mario Parente from RHOgroup, and Ina Fiterau from InfoFusion lab in the past on problems in applied computer vision and deep learning. My industry experience includes two research internships at Apple and one at Philips Lighting Research, where I worked on a variety of topics from scene understanding to audio processing. In my free time, I love to experiment with coffee brewing techniques (inspired by James Hoffman), cook gourmet dishes (like those by Gordon Ramsay), and listen to classic rock music (Iâ€™m a big fan of Queen).
