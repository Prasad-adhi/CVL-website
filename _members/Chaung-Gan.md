I am a faculty member at UMass Amherst and a research manager at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. I was a postdoc at MIT, working with Prof. Antonio Torralba, Prof. Daniela Rus, and Prof. Josh Tenenbaum. Before that, I completed my PhD with the highest honor at Tsinghua University, where I was supervised by Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, AI, cognitive science, and robotics. The overarching goal of my research is to build a human-like autonomous agents that is capable of sensing, reasoning, and acting in the physical world. My works have been recognized by Microsoft Fellowship, Baidu Fellowship, and media coverage from CNN, BBC, The New York Times, WIRED, Forbes, and MIT Tech Review.
