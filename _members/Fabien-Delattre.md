I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am advised by Prof. Erik Learned-Miller and part of the Vision lab. I received a M.S. in Computer Sciences from ISEN Lille engineering school (2019) in France.

In the past, I interned at Dolby Laboratories, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Samsung Strategy and Innovation Center (SSIC) and Thales.
